hola amigos! ðŸ‘‹

today is the day when I wrote my first Selenium tests. Each test suite is followed by BDD test scenario for demonstration purposes.

I mainly wanted to practice with new tech stack: 
- node.js
- mocha
- selenium webdriver
- diff ways to retrieve elements (css, xpath, through array)
- diff manipulation with elements (sendKeys, getText, getCssValue, etc.)
